This program can be run by the following two commands:

'gcc traffic.c -o traffic -lm'
'./traffic'

The program asks whether you want to print information about the crossroads 
in between. By typing 0 and pressing enter, no information is printed. By
answering this question with 1, each crossroad is printed before, while and 
after action selection.
